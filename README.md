MULTIm-8 stands for MULTiple autoMATE. This batch programming architecture was initially designed for 8 ICs and hence the name.

The MULTIm-8 System can program multiple ATtiny85 ICs with the same principle program but with a different hardcoded ID. This is useful in a system identification of slaves is necessary in order to perform slave-specific communication.

Presently, the system is designed for Linux and can autonomously program upto 16 ATtiny85 ICs through an Arduino Uno board as ISP.
